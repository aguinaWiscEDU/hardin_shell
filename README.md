# hardin_shell
This was a shell implementation for my CS 537 course.

This program is to implement/build a shell program to use in a terminal. The shell can read from a file, or pass commands through a batch mode. This program is easily loadable and can be up and running after download.

TO BUILD:

Download wish.c to any directory

Open a terminal window to the directory and enter a gcc/clang command

Run output and the shell should startup!
